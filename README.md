# Using Neural Kernel Methods for Infinite-Width Recommender Systems

This repository contains the code necessary to run the experiments for the Master Thesis submitted as a part of the MSc in Statistical Science degree at the University of Oxford in September 2023. The main functions, showing how the computational experiments were implemented, are available in the file \verb|experiments.py|.

The code is based on the library developed by Sachdeva, available at: https://github.com/noveens/infinite_ae_cf
